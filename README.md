# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates the application of the **K-Means clustering algorithm** to segment customers based on purchasing behavior and demographic attributes using the `customers.csv` dataset.

## Objective

- Analyze customer data to uncover patterns and natural groupings.
- Use K-Means clustering to divide customers into meaningful segments.
- Visualize the clusters and gain insights for marketing or business decisions.

## Dataset

**File Name:** customers.csv

The dataset contains records for multiple customers with features such as:
- Age
- Annual Income
- Spending Score
- (Additional features may be included)

These numerical features are used to cluster customers based on similarity.

## Concepts Covered

- Unsupervised Learning
- K-Means Clustering Algorithm
- Feature Scaling
- Euclidean Distance and Centroid Updates
- Elbow Method for Optimal Number of Clusters
- Cluster Visualization

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Workflow Summary

1. Load the `customers.csv` dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. Select relevant features for clustering (e.g., income, spending score).
4. Apply feature scaling (if needed).
5. Run K-Means clustering with different values of K.
6. Use the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters.
7. Visualize the resulting customer segments using scatter plots.

## Conclusion

K-Means clustering helps uncover hidden customer groups based on their behavior and characteristics. This segmentation is valuable for targeted marketing, personalized services, and strategic decision-making.
